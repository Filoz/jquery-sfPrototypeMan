# jquery.sfPrototypeMan

A jQuery plugin for the management of HTML forms generated by Symfony 2 with the [allow_add option](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/forms/types/collection.html#allow-add) enabled.

## Installation

Include script *after* the jQuery library

    <script src="/path/to/jquery.sfprototypeman.js"></script>

## Usage

Run
    jQuery().sfPrototypeMan();
to extend Symfony generated forms with collections that ("allow_add" option) offer the [ability to add unknown/unlimited number of sub-forms/fields of a certain type](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/form/form_collections.html#cookbook-form-collections-new-prototype).

## Settings

Settings can be passed to sfPrototypeMan to override the *defaultOptions*
    jQuery().sfPrototypeMan({
    	addButtonText: 'Give me one more field',
    	rmButtonText: '-'
    });

## Events

You can attach listeners to sfPrototypeMan that will respond to events emitted by third-party code on the nodes handled by sfPrototypeMan, that is the elements with the prototype data attribute.

### Default listeners

By default, sfPrototypeMan integrates with jQuery UI sortable by listening to the *sortupdate* event and responding respectively.

### Attach more listeners

You can attach additional listeners, and thus make it integrate with third-party code in a clean fashing, like so
    jQuery().sfPrototypeMan({
    	containerListeners: {
    		myEventName: function(event) {
    			// your code reacting to myEventName
    			// "this" in here will be bound to be the SfPrototypeContainer object
    		}
    	}
    });
In this example, the event *myEventName* call an element monitored by sfPrototypeMan will result in the anonymous callback function be called.
